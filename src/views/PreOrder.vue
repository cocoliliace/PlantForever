        <hr />
        <p>
          In addition to the order, a 50% advance payment of the total order will be required to secure the selected trees.
          The remaining 50% of the total order will be paid when the tree planting/transfer occurs.
          If the customer cancels the order, then the 50% advancement will not be refunded.
          If PlantForever is unable to provide the requested trees, a full refund will be issued.

        <p>
          We cannot confirm this far in advance whether the trees you order will be available to us next season.
          This is all dependent on the tree providers and whether the trees are made available.
          We will do our best to accommodate the order if the selected trees arenâ€™t available, including a full issued refund if required.
